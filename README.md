## 📋 Overview

SQL (Structured Query Language) is the standard language for managing relational databases. This repository includes:

- Scripts for creating database schemas.
- CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operation examples.
- Advanced SQL techniques such as joins, subqueries, and stored procedures.
- Performance optimization techniques like indexing and query tuning.
- Real-world examples to implement and practice.

This repository is designed for learners, developers, and database administrators who want to enhance their SQL skills and solve real-world problems.

SOURCE schemas/employees.sql;
Run Queries: Open any file from the queries/ directory and execute the SQL statements. Example:

sql
Copy code
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE department = 'Sales';
Optimize Performance: Refer to the optimization/ directory for scripts to improve database performance, such as adding indexes or normalizing tables.

Explore Use Cases: Study the examples/ directory to see how SQL is applied in practical scenarios like e-commerce or library management.
